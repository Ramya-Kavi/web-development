      <p>At a distance of 34 Kms from Thanjavur & 284 Kms from Chennai, Darasuram, a small town 8 Kms away from Kumbakonam is known for the <strong>Airavathesvara Temple</strong> built by <strong>Rajaraja Chola II </strong>in the 12th century CE. This temple is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site 'Great Living Chola Temples'.

  This temple is a storehouse of art and architecture. The vimana is 85 feet high. The front mandapam itself is in the form of a huge chariot drawn by horses. The temple has some exquisite stone carvings. The main deity's consort Periya Nayaki Amman temple is situated adjacent to Airavateshwarar temple.

  The legend goes to show that Airavata, the white elephant of Indra, worshipped Lord Siva in this temple; so did also the King of Death, Yama. Inscriptions on the temple walls say that it was known in those days as Raja Rajeswaram and Raja Rajapuram.

<h2>CHARIOT WHEEL CARVED ON THE MUKHA MANDAPA OF AIRAVATESVARA TEMPLE AT DARASURAM</h2>
<p>According to history, Raja Raja Chola II shifted his capital from Gangaikondacholapuram to Palaiyarai and
renamed it as Raja Raja Puram . The Temple he constructed here was named Raja Rajeschuram which though
 the word of mouth evolved into  Tharechuram, Darachuram and finally Darasuram.
 Airavatesvara temple has also been declared as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.

<p>Legend has it that the white elephant Airavata of God Indra lost its colour due to a curse by sage Durvasa .  Airavata regained its colour after worshipping Lord Shiva in this temple and hence the deity was known as Airavatesvara.</p>
<hr>
<p>The mukha mandapa of the temple has been ornamentally shaped like a chariot being pulled by elephants and horses. This is followed by the main mandapa & sanctum sanctorum . Outer walls of the temple have been filled with intricate sculptures of goddesses and other historical incidents from past.</p>

<h2>Nomenclature</h2>
<img src="images/water tank.jpg" alt="">
<p>The Airavatesvara Shiva temple has a water tank. This tank has a connected channel that brings in Cauveri River water where Hindus gather annually to take a dip. The local mythology narrates how Airavata, or Indra's (malla) white elephant was restored with clean, white skin after he took a dip in this tank. This legend is carved in stone in the inner shrine, and this Indra's elephant gives this temple its name</p>

<h2>World Heritage Site </h2>
  <p>Airavatesvara Temple was added to UNESCO's World Heritage Site list of Great Living Chola Temples in the year 2004. The Great Living Chola Temples includes the Brihadeeswara Temple at Thanjavur, the Temple of Gangaikondacholisvaram at Gangaikonda Cholapuram and the Airavatesvara Temple at Darasuram. All
of these temples were built by the Cholas between the 10th and 12th centuries CE and have a lot of similarities</p>
